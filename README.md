In this week you have to write your own gem. Gem is very simple, all it has to do is receiving mode name as a string and give an appropriate output.

You have tests (test/test_iaau.rb) file with the requirements, and the files to write code in (lib/iaau.rb and lib/modechecker.rb).
Make sure you have written code that passes tests.

NOTE: to run tests use **rake test** command.
